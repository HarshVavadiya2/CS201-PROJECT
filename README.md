###Applications & Implementation of Zip Tree and Bloom Filter as a part of CS201 (DSA) project.
Implementation of ZIP TREE and some of its functions such as insert, search , traversal, etc. We have also analysed the algorithm and studied their average time complexities.

###How to Run The Program
The program can be compiled and run directly in the terminal using gcc.

###Expected inputs and outputs:  

**For Library Book Recomendation** :
First line will show the execution time of the code for creating the Zip Tree using the input.txt file

Then it will ask for the entry number(roll number) of the student. It will check wheter there is already a student data present with us ,if not, creates the new entry for it and stores its data. It only takes the natural numbers as input.

After which a query will be asked that if you want to borrow a book or you want to be recomend a book.You have to press "B" for the borrow and "R" for the recomendation.

If borrow book is choosen, then it will ask for the book number to be borrowed. It take natural number as input.Which then search for the book, whether your typed book number is present or not.If book is present ,it will be borrowed,and if not, will again ask you to Borrow or Recommend.

If recommend book is choosen, then it will show the book that is not read by you. Then it will ask you to borrow that book or recommend the another book.

**Malacious url** :
First it will ask for query,whether to check url , report url or quit."A" for check url , "B" for report url and "Q" for quit.

If check url is choosen , it will ask for url to check.If it is safe to visit, it will show that it is safe to visit else it will warn to go to that website.

If report url is choosen, it will ask for url you want to report. It will record that reported website and warn from next time.
